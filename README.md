# HtmlCompiler2.0
An HTML compiler (more accurately referred to as an HTML interpreter or editor) is a software tool that allows users to write, edit, and view the results of HTML code in real-time. This helps developers and learners to quickly test and debug HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript without needing a full development environment.
